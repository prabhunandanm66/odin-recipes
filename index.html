      <ul>
        2 large eggs, at room temperature
      </ul>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        1 cup caramel bits (such as KraftÂ®, optional)
      </ul>
      <ul>
        3 ounces shortbread cookies
      </ul>
      <ul>
        1/4 cup unsalted butter
      </ul>
      <ul>
        1/3 cup whule milk
      </ul>
      <ul>
        2 cups confectioner's sugar
      </ul>
    </li>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <li>
      <ol>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and position a rack in
        the center. Coat a 9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray. Line pan
        with parchment paper, leaving 1 to 2 inches of overhang; coat parchment
        with cooking spray
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Whisk together flour, baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium
        bowl.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        In a large bowl, mash bananas with a fork until coarsely mashed. Add 6
        tablespoons melted butter and the sour cream and mix until well
        combined. Whisk in 1 cup brown sugar, then the eggs, then 2 teaspoons
        vanilla until well combined. Stir in flour mixture with a silicone
        spatula. Fold in caramel bits. Pour batter into the prepared pan and
        spread in an even layer.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cake springs back lightly when touched
        in center, 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack. Let cool
        completely.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        While cake cools, make crumb topping. Put cookies in a large zip-top
        bag, seal bag, and use a rolling pin to crush cookies into coarse
        crumbs. Transfer crumbs to a small bowl. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons
        melted butter and dash of salt.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        For caramel glaze, melt the 1/4 cup butter in a small saucepan over
        medium heat. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar and cook, stirring
        occasionally, until mixture begins to boil. Add milk and bring to a
        simmer. Remove from heat and whisk in powdered sugar and remaining 1
        teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon salt until completely smooth.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Spread hot glaze in an even layer over cake. Immediately sprinkle with
        crumb topping. Let cake stand at room temperature until glaze sets,
        about 15 minutes.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Run a small offset spatula or a knife around outside of cake and use
        parchment lining to transfer cake to a cutting board. Cut into 12
        triangles. Chill in an airtight container until ready to serve, up to 4
        days.
      </ol>
